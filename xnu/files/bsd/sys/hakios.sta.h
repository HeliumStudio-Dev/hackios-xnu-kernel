/*
 * Darwin-on-hakios: the station boundary.
 *
 * On one side whatever does the scanning and the joining with a radio: the station logic over
 * ath11k on the phone (wifi/lx in the repository). On the other whoever wants a network: the
 * Apple80211 requests of iOS's Wi-Fi side, answered in bsd/dev/hakios.apple80211.c, and the
 * kernel's own join of the network it was given in a file (bsd/dev/hakios.wifi.c). Frames do
 * not pass here, and neither does "the link is up": those go through bsd/sys/hakios.net.h,
 * which the station side calls itself.
 *
 * Between the two stands bsd/dev/hakios.sta.c: one thread, on which every call into the station
 * side is made, one at a time, and what the last scan heard, kept for whoever asks.
 *
 * Nothing but C's own types here: the station side is not compiled as XNU's code.
